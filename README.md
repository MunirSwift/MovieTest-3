# MovieTest-3

I have used Podfile kingfisher for image access, 
and also used SwiftyJson for parsing json response by prototype modals.

There are 2 view controller and 1 youtubeclient with notification observer for detecting user event or on completing movie handler.

First viewcontroller will display the load the popular movie into the tableview.
2nd viewcontroller will render the details about the movie. There is Watch button for playing live movie.

This swift sample is developed for Adaptive Layout which means any screen sizez or screen orientation, can work on them easiy with intrinsic layout theme.

This is just an example to justify the way of Swift coding.

Thank you,
